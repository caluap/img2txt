# img2txt
Translates a grayscale image as series of weight-axis variations

The purpose of this script is to generate a wall of text from a list with the name of hundreds brazilian musicians. In it, each letter will have its weight axis modulated according to a grayscale image.

It's similar to those ASCII to image converters, but can be used with a real, readable text.

I'm (possibly) using this in a poster project, but the tool can be useful in other situations.
